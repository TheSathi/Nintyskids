my story
The time being in me 
Crawling , walking in the foot step
Leaving behind the story of my poem
Collecting the breath of my days
Chasing as the reviewer of traveler
My broken, scrambled and errecting soul
Sometime makes castle
And sometimes goes in disguise
Thoughtful thought to be or not to be
