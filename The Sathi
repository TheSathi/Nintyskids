my story
The time being in me 
Crawling , walking in the foot step

Chasing as the reviewer of traveler
My broken, scrambled and errecting soul

And sometimes goes in disguise
Thoughtful thought to be or not to be

should look up on it as a great fortune that for some reason or other our mind processes and attraction for the higher and eternal things and should see that we studyly and gradually proceed along the higher path never flagging till we reach the goal our spiritual server is to be maintain but we very often run the race of becoming slag The spiritual survin stops in most people after they have taken to The spiritual life for a certain time dear minds are two restless and two outgoing to keep a this picture forward and intensity for a very long time and to go on study leave it there is spiritual practice and reading and studies so we should be and our god tennesity is the one thing needed for spiritual life all progress can only be had through greatness and density flag in one of his famous poem our birthday to come
he says the world is too much with us late and soon getting and spending belay waste our power we should not spend all time in this state
where is in reality no human earning can ever find statistics in anything that is not permanent and changing however much people may try to deceive themselves on this point the old void horns them again and again and mostly in a more terrible and relentless form then before people see happiness outside in external objects in the physical aspects of man and woman but true happiness lies within ourselves it is our in a lineable heritage external things can never bring to happiness to US 
and what little we get disappear in no time we come in the mistakes of looking at a certain span of time instead of looking at the whole of our lifetime temporary happiness there is no doubt in Worli relations in human love and human affection but temporary happiness can never mean real happiness rather it is the opposite of it to happiness is the intrinsic nature of the inner cells that is have the desired to know our nature to know I to self int in self realization alone lies real blessed Ness.
even though the higher self of man is a part of the divine and is actually inspirable from it still the devotee gives more importance to God then to his own soul to him God alone is the repository of all peace and blessness we should try to look within and find him CTET within are own heart these body of hours is the living temple of god this is a concept we find this test again and again and all the scriptures the best temples of the divine are the however the great profit and why they exert the greatest influence
those who have realise the truth in their own souls alone can teach others the way 12 years realization the lord is always at the back of our mind at the back can of our personality and only if we can pray with a fervent heart will the prayer be heard otherwise not we should never think in terms of early happiness while playing happiness as it is ordinary understood innovial index of a spiritual life no proof whatever of a spiritual progress a realisation is spiritual happiness is of a different kind it is the piece of God which pass all understanding
we should not ask God for the things of the world suppose he grant them the material things may bring troubles to when we approach this great phone give us we should never ask him for birthday things connected with personal wishes and desires email approach the largest for saving our sols from getting drone in the ocean of earlyness and infection for material things ordinary if we feel unhappy we would rather adjust ourself to our unhappy nice and clean to our desires and fancy then change your ways and come to truth and we are so body that we stress physical enjoyment more than anything else and I am not prepare to renounce it rather we can desperately to its different forms all the we get nothing but cakes and glows again and again such is the tremendous power of Maya or ignorance
the great father on the great mother is witnessing the children at play it is only when the child gets tired of its toys and child is occupations that the lord really comes to eat and draws it away from the Play land of illusion children play with sweets with dolls with toy soldiers with toys houses with toy cars in the thing can be done by the lord until they get tired of these and turn away from them in other discuss got takes it as great fun and then one day the child has become a little grown up and cries what have I done with my life and the lord says yes what have you done my child who ask you to do it who asked you to go on playing indefinitely in such a foolish who ask you to get hurt and get angled with your voice who did it all and then often it is already too late and the child sites in the ruins of its shattered life and whales
strike for the highest all have an opportunity to follow channel and better ways but we clinch to our particular toys and do not let go over hold so we have to suffer and we suffer until we learn the great lesson life teaches again and again in memorable ways and come to act wise features as most people try to achieve their ambitions and ideals we should describe for spiritual life and illumination but this most people want to and it depends only on our own choice whether we take the politely life or The spiritual life with the life of slavery and fear or that of freedom and fearlessness
we must is type to achieve something that is higher that is not subject to change and decade but we very of 10 choose the path of avidya will fully and deliberately because we clean to our Phantom of physical and emotional enjoyment which of which after all we shall have to give up Sonar all letter be all one day must let go the hold and if you do not do this of our own free will the toy will be turn away from us and this will mean great sorrow and in many cases a broken heart for most
for most people this is the only way in which they can be made to learn their lessons but it is very painful and usually takes many lies we should try to live us spiritual life knowingly consciously deliberately in a speed of dedication and single has of purpose this feel of ours may be directed towards the higher channels of life for towards the lowers just as we please
if you are able to Rose tremendous enthusiasm in our cells for the coal to be attend then only shall we get the necessary energy to strive for it and do our atmost in the world of the spirit you very often find people with account in brain they do not care to follow any definite system no person with a metal brain can have any success in the world and much less so in the spiritual world settle once for all what you really want very often we want to attend peace but follow apart that can only and restlessness and trouble there is a saying in Bengal there are some people who win they want to go towards the east start walking towards the west and if you ask them why they do so they reply because I want to go towards the north
the test of truth the lover when dreaming of his beloved emergence think that have no reality the man to emergence things that do not exist at all hollanciation are to be avoided in spiritual life we must try to get aglims of truth by following a systematic course of a spiritual practice if such a glance comes underwears and if we are not properly prepared for it through long and regular training for life we must first learn how to become fit for such games great suffering to the aspirant not happiness in the intervite stages his life becomes very difficult then he has no longer any real interest in that he has in the world and cannot yet obtain self realization which is still beyond his reach it is just like hanging in mid year without being able to go either up or down
the test of truth is this where as in the case of wordly things and Worli relationships you can never get any ultimate satisfaction in the case of spirituality and spiritual life you can get that perfect satisfaction which is not dependent upon anything external so the great says Narad says realising that a man attains perfection in mortality and ultimate full filman
the really thirsty man always need water but those who are not thirsty can do without it for a long time that really sincere aspirant will do all he is told but people are so half hurted and so little sincere that they are in no great hurry to follow the advice they are given

the power of reality is he it is often very difficult to have your earning for God in the beginning and the prison is that got does not see my reality to us with most of us this bodies our solved and it is for the enjoyment of this body on the material plane it need not necessarily be a very gross form of enjoyment that we are most initials religion to most of us is something highly and make your kind of fashion just like so many other fashions but if some day through our specialist driving got comes to be a reality you feel that our whole being at response to that reality and longs for it alone if the world is real to us it absorbs of entire attention if something else is real that too does the same that which we take to be real for the time being affects stars up our feelings draws out I will it occupies our hole intellect impact our hole being response to this reality
if we carefully study our own lies and the lives of sayings we find a great difference it is the reality that affects the minds of both but the reality something different to the what it is to us ordinary people to us this world is real to them The spiritual word alone is real their whole life is filled with this one idea how to realise with divine how to make him or reality instead of an intellectual and work concept if we are able to appreciate but the call reality we can also appreciate why they are ever ready even to lay down their life for the sake of God realisation
we should not however blindly emitted the sands they may appear rather unconventional or strange in their behaviour but as we have said all the other thirst for god is based on a clear conception of reality those of first for whom this sense bound world alone is real should be careful in our speech your status for a success depends on the regularity and intensity of a daily spiritual practice very often we are so careless in this without study practice nothing can spiritual life spiritual life must be a life of dedication to the highest life of conservation and secrefice and one pointedness so we should we more wide a week and more careful about our own thoughts for our own benefit and for the benefit of others to home our thought of the greed or violence ours then poise and gas then that created by poison gas people who do not even know impurities but why our thought we help others in their struggle after purity
he must rules at amendous define this content the this content the mistakes of all ages peak of unless we are able to rows in the soul this divine discontent which can destroy all attachment to worldly things and desires we will not be able to get real learning for speech realization there can never be any real piece in the world in it as best weekend their must never be any kind of lackless in our starving nor any kind of satisfaction with state of bond dates such forms of satisfaction are very dangerous for all spiritual experience he must consciously burning the fire of anchoring and learning for the higher life we must never energy for anything mus t never prefer the piece of
there can be no security unless we have already proceded very for towards the ultimate goal any devotee me come to grief or have a nice day fall at any moment before he has attend to self realization so we should never disc too much relying on our own strength before having advanced considerably
spiritual practice and prayer must be intensified constant period day and night constant meditation constant thinking of higher thought would do us immense good the mind of the beginner must be kept constantly busy with divine ideas so as to create the habit after having created the right habit the path become a motor and there is less stain in the life of The spiritual spent you must give our hole mind of God not nearly a bit of it Shri Ramkrishna used to say if I want to buy a piece of cloth but one rupee I will have to pay one rupee and not one paisa less otherwise I shall not get it so also spiritual life if you don't be full attention you simply don't get anything if after practicing meditation for a few months or even years you find that you have got nothing is specially you have nobody else to bring what we need is preserve and their must be study regular practice let's rather die in the struggle to keep our body and mind pure then give it up what does it matter even if we die what matter is that we realize that we attend are full stature our to being if we struggle our most if we do our most will have full filled over duty then the rest must be left to the divine here to self resignation to the lord have their place

Prahlad was an example
